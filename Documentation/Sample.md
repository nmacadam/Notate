# Notate
A note component for your inspector.

Use the `Note` component to add in-inspector comments or documentation.  Edit the note contents by clicking and typing like any text field, and customize the icon by clicking on it.
You can further customize the following by putting the inspector into Debug mode:
- Message alignment & anchoring
- Background color
- Icon (specify any built-in icon [by name](https://github.com/halak/unity-editor-icons))

`Note` components are not included in build.
